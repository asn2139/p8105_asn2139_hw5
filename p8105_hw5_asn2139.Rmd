## Problem 1

```{r}
homicide_df=
  read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state= str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved= case_when(
      disposition=="Closed without arrest"~ "unsolved",
      disposition=="Open/No arrest"       ~ "unsolved",
      disposition== "Closed by arrest"      ~"solved"
      )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state,resolved)
```
